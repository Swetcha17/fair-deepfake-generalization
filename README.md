# fair-deepfake-generalization
This project studies demographic bias in open-set deepfake detection using softmax thresholding. Real images are from FairFace, and fakes are generated via SimSwap FaceSwap. Models trained on single- and multi-race data are evaluated for generalization using AUROC, F1-score, accuracy, and diversity scores.
